# ✈️ Twitter US Airline Sentiment Analysis  

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project on the **Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset**. The dataset includes tweets directed at major US airlines, labeled with sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral). The aim is to clean, explore, and visualize the data to uncover insights into customer sentiment and airline performance. 

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Perform data cleaning on raw Twitter text (remove noise, handle missing values, standardize).  
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and patterns.  
- Use **visualizations** to understand sentiment distribution, airline performance, and tweet behavior.  
- Identify common themes in positive and negative feedback.  
- Summarize insights into **reports** that could guide airline decision-making.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries  
- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas / NumPy** → data cleaning & preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** → data visualization  
- **WordCloud** → text-based visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** → clustering & feature extraction  

---

## 📌 Project Workflow  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values and duplicates  
   - Normalize text (lowercasing, stopwords removal, punctuation cleanup)  
   - Extract features (tweet length, hashtags, mentions, keywords)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Sentiment distribution across tweets  
   - Airline-wise tweet counts and sentiment proportions  
   - Most frequent words and hashtags  
   - Tweet length vs sentiment analysis  

3. **Visualizations**  
   - Bar charts, pie charts, and histograms  
   - Word clouds for positive, negative, and neutral tweets  
   - Boxplots comparing tweet length across sentiments.
   - Clustering of tweets into topics (service, delays, staff, etc.)  

---

## 📈 Findings
- Most tweets are **negative**, highlighting customer frustration with delays and service.  
- **United Airlines** and **American Airlines** attract higher negative sentiment compared to others.  
- Positive tweets often mention good staff behavior, while negative ones focus on delays and cancellations.  
- Tweet length shows variation: negative tweets tend to be longer and more detailed.
